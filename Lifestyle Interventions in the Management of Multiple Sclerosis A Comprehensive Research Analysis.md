# **Lifestyle Interventions in the Management of Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Research Analysis**

## **1. Introduction: The Growing Interest in Lifestyle Interventions for Multiple Sclerosis**

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is recognized as a chronic autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the central nervous system, leading to demyelination, axonal damage, and a spectrum of progressive neurological disabilities 1. While advancements in disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have offered benefits in altering the course of the disease, these treatments often do not fully address the wide array of symptoms experienced by individuals with MS. In particular, the management of fatigue, a prevalent and often debilitating symptom, presents ongoing challenges with limited effective pharmacological options 2.

Recognizing the limitations of current treatments, a significant proportion of individuals with MS are proactively seeking and implementing non-pharmacological approaches to manage their condition, with dietary modifications being particularly prevalent 5. Surveys indicate that approximately half of the MS population reports making changes to their diet, highlighting a substantial interest in complementary strategies 5. This proactive engagement underscores a potential desire for greater personal control over health and suggests that conventional treatment approaches may not be fully meeting the needs of all individuals with MS.

Lifestyle medicine, which focuses on modifiable environmental factors such as diet, exercise, stress, and sleep, offers a holistic approach that has the potential to influence the pathogenesis and progression of MS 2. Environmental factors are increasingly recognized as playing a significant role in the development and course of MS 2. The proactive behavior of MS patients in exploring lifestyle modifications indicates a possible unmet need within traditional treatment paradigms and a desire for more comprehensive strategies. Healthcare professionals who are well-informed about and capable of guiding patients on evidence-based lifestyle interventions can play a vital role in addressing this need. The types of modifications patients are making and their perceived outcomes can provide valuable insights for future research and the development of clinical recommendations.

This comprehensive research report aims to analyze the scientific evidence supporting various lifestyle interventions in the management of MS and related conditions. It will explore the potential mechanisms of action of these interventions, evaluate the strength of the available evidence, and discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating lifestyle medicine into mainstream healthcare for individuals with MS. The report will thoroughly examine the role of specific interventions, including various dietary approaches (such as the Swank Diet, Wahls Protocol, DASH Diet, MIND Diet, low saturated fat diets, nutrient-dense diets, anti-inflammatory diets, and intermittent fasting), exercise and physical activity, stress management techniques, sleep hygiene practices, and supplementation with Vitamin D, Omega-3 fatty acids, and CBD.

## **2. The Evidence for Dietary Interventions in Multiple Sclerosis**

Despite the growing interest in the role of diet in MS management, the current scientific evidence supporting specific dietary recommendations remains generally weak due to several methodological limitations present in many studies 5. These limitations include small sample sizes, a lack of appropriate control groups, significant heterogeneity in the dietary interventions studied, and a high or moderate risk of bias in the design and execution of the research. A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis, which rigorously assesses the available evidence, concluded that the evidence for dietary interventions in improving MS-related outcomes is sparse and uncertain, highlighting a significant need for more robust and well-designed research in this area 5. The consistent finding of low credibility and a high risk of bias across multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses underscores the critical need for future research to prioritize rigorous, well-designed randomized controlled trials. These trials should incorporate larger sample sizes, standardized dietary protocols, appropriate control groups, and the measurement of clinically relevant outcomes to definitively establish the efficacy of specific dietary interventions for individuals with MS. Given the preliminary nature of much of the dietary research in MS, healthcare professionals should exercise caution when making recommendations, emphasizing the importance of patients discussing any potential dietary changes with their healthcare providers. Furthermore, researchers should prioritize conducting high-quality studies to provide clearer and more reliable guidance in this area.

The **Swank Diet**, developed by Dr. Roy Swank starting in the mid-1940s, is a dietary approach that centers on a very low intake of saturated fat, initially recommending no more than 20 grams per day, later refined to a limit of 15 grams per day 6. The diet also advises limiting the intake of unsaturated fats to between 20 and 50 grams per day. It involves excluding red meat for the first year, restricting dairy consumption to options with less than 1% butterfat, and avoiding processed foods that contain saturated fat. The Swank diet encourages the consumption of white meat poultry (without skin), whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and recommends daily supplementation with cod liver oil and a multivitamin 6. Dr. Swank's proposed mechanism for the diet's effect was based on his observation of a geographical correlation between high saturated fat intake and a higher prevalence of MS 16. He theorized that high saturated fat consumption leads to the clumping of blood cells, which could obstruct the small blood vessels in the blood-brain barrier, thereby contributing to the inflammation and lesion formation characteristic of MS 15. Dr. Swank conducted long-term observational studies, following patients for up to 34 and even 50 years, and reported significantly lower rates of disability progression and mortality in those who adhered closely to the diet 21. However, these studies were limited by the absence of a control group, randomization, and blinded assessment, which makes it challenging to definitively attribute the observed outcomes solely to the diet 16. A more recent 36-week randomized controlled trial comparing the Swank diet to the Wahls diet found significant reductions in fatigue and improved quality of life in both dietary groups 6. Additionally, a 2021 study suggested that the Swank diet might offer benefits in reducing fatigue in individuals with MS 12. Despite these more recent findings, a systematic review and network meta-analysis assessed the credibility of the evidence for the Swank diet as very low due to the methodological limitations of the included trials, such as a high risk of bias and small sample sizes 5. While the Swank diet has a long history within the MS community and some individuals report experiencing benefits, the scientific evidence derived from rigorous controlled trials remains limited. The proposed vascular mechanism involving saturated fat is biologically plausible but requires further direct investigation. The more recent positive findings regarding fatigue and quality of life are encouraging but necessitate confirmation through larger, higher-quality studies. Furthermore, the strict nature of the dietary restrictions might present challenges for long-term adherence for some individuals.

The **Wahls Protocol**, developed by Dr. Terry Wahls, a physician living with MS, is a modified Paleolithic diet that emphasizes a very high daily intake of specific types of vegetables, aiming for nine or more cups, including dark green leafy vegetables, sulfur-rich vegetables (like cabbage and mushrooms), and deeply colored fruits and vegetables (like carrots and berries) 5. The diet also includes moderate amounts of high-quality animal protein, preferably grass-fed meats, wild-caught fish, and organ meats, along with healthy fats, especially omega-3 fatty acids. In some versions, the protocol limits or eliminates gluten-free grains and legumes. The Wahls Protocol excludes dairy, eggs, processed foods, and added sugars 5. Dr. Wahls initially theorized that increasing the intake of specific nutrient-dense foods would provide essential micronutrients to support neuronal health and mitochondrial function 8. Subsequently, she proposed that restricting lectins, which are found in grains, legumes, and nightshade vegetables, could reduce intestinal permeability and subsequent inflammation within the central nervous system 8. The protocol also aims to reduce overall inflammation and oxidative stress, which are implicated in MS pathology 105. Similar to the Swank diet, much of the initial evidence supporting the Wahls Protocol comes from Dr. Wahls' personal experience and small case studies reporting improvements in fatigue and quality of life 8. A 36-week randomized controlled trial comparing the Wahls and Swank diets demonstrated significant and comparable reductions in fatigue and improvements in quality of life in both groups 6. Additionally, a small study indicated that individuals following the Wahls diet consumed adequate amounts of most micronutrients 8. However, the overall body of research remains limited, and larger, well-controlled studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings for a broader population of individuals with MS 5. A systematic review and network meta-analysis also rated the credibility of evidence for the Paleolithic diet, of which the Wahls Protocol is a modification, as very low 5. The Wahls Protocol, with its emphasis on a very high intake of fruits and vegetables, aligns with general recommendations for a healthy diet and has shown promising effects on fatigue and quality of life in limited studies. The proposed mechanisms targeting nutrient deficiencies, gut health, and inflammation are relevant to the pathophysiology of MS. However, the restrictive nature of the diet might impact long-term adherence, and more rigorous research is necessary to validate its effectiveness and determine its suitability for different individuals with MS.

The **DASH Diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)** is a dietary pattern that emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, while limiting saturated fats, red meat, sodium, and sugary foods 11. Primarily known for its benefits in managing hypertension, the DASH diet may also help reduce inflammation and improve blood pressure, which is often more prevalent in individuals with MS 107. Currently, a protocol study is underway to investigate the effects of the DASH diet on stress, anxiety, depression, and fatigue in individuals with relapsing-remitting MS 107. It is also noted that the **MIND Diet (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay)** incorporates elements from the DASH diet 11. The MIND diet combines aspects of both the Mediterranean and DASH diets, with a specific focus on foods known to support brain health, such as berries and green leafy vegetables. It encourages the consumption of natural plant-based foods and limits animal-based products and foods high in saturated fat 5. Research suggests that the MIND diet may have neuroprotective effects and improve cognitive function in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases 11. A case-control study found a negative association between adherence to the MIND diet and the odds of having MS, indicating a potential role in disease prevention 18. Furthermore, a before-and-after intervention study demonstrated improvements in fatigue and physical quality of life, along with positive changes in serum biomarkers related to neurotrophic factors and oxidative stress, in MS patients following the MIND diet 17. A study funded by the National MS Society also reported that higher adherence to the MIND diet was associated with more preserved brain tissue in individuals with early MS 108. The DASH and, particularly, the MIND diets, with their emphasis on reducing inflammation and promoting brain health, show promising associations with a reduced risk of MS and improved outcomes such as fatigue, quality of life, and brain integrity. Given their established benefits in other neurodegenerative and cardiovascular conditions, further research specifically in MS is warranted to explore their therapeutic potential. These diets offer a potentially less restrictive approach compared to the Swank or Wahls protocols and align with broader healthy eating recommendations, making them potentially more accessible and sustainable dietary strategies for individuals with MS.

**Low Saturated Fat Diets**, similar to the principles of the Swank diet, aim to mitigate inflammation and oxidative stress by limiting the intake of saturated fats 14. Research suggests that diets low in saturated fat, particularly those that are also high in unsaturated fats, may offer benefits for individuals with MS, especially in terms of reducing fatigue 5. **Nutrient-Dense Diets** prioritize the consumption of a wide variety of whole, unprocessed foods to ensure an adequate intake of essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients that are crucial for overall health and may play a role in managing MS symptoms 2. While there is no single, universally recommended nutrient-dense diet for MS, maintaining a balanced and varied intake is considered important for supporting overall well-being 97. Emerging evidence indicates that specific nutrients, such as Vitamin C, Folic Acid, and Fish Oil, might have a role in decreasing the risk and severity of MS 114. **Anti-Inflammatory Diets** focus on increasing the consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, fiber, and phytochemicals, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, while limiting or avoiding pro-inflammatory foods like red and processed meats, sugary drinks, and refined grains 1. Studies utilizing the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) have demonstrated a positive correlation between a higher pro-inflammatory dietary potential and an increased likelihood of developing MS 117. Some research suggests that adhering to anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, can lead to a reduction in inflammatory markers and MS-related fatigue 120. The overarching theme across these various dietary approaches is the importance of consuming a balanced, whole-foods-based diet that prioritizes nutrient density and limits pro-inflammatory components like saturated fats and processed foods. This aligns with general healthy eating guidelines and provides a biologically plausible rationale for potentially mitigating inflammation and supporting neurological health in individuals with MS. While specific diets are being investigated, the consistent emphasis on a generally healthy dietary pattern provides a foundational recommendation that healthcare professionals can confidently advise their patients with MS to follow.

**Intermittent Fasting (IF)** involves various eating patterns characterized by cycles of eating and voluntary fasting. Common methods include time-restricted eating (TRE), where all food is consumed within a limited daily window (typically 8-10 hours); alternate-day fasting (ADF), which involves alternating between days of normal eating and days of severe calorie restriction or complete fasting; and the 5:2 diet, where normal eating occurs for five days of the week, and calorie intake is restricted to around 500-600 calories on two non-consecutive days 11. The proposed mechanism for IF's potential benefits in MS includes the modulation of the immune system, reduction of inflammation, promotion of neuroprotection, and influence on the gut microbiome 59. Animal studies have shown promising results, suggesting that IF can reduce myelin damage and the severity of MS-like symptoms 57. Preliminary human studies indicate that IF, including TRE and intermittent calorie restriction, might be feasible and acceptable for individuals with MS and could potentially lead to improvements in symptoms, quality of life, and certain immune and metabolic markers 57. Intermittent fasting is an emerging and promising area of research in the context of MS. While the initial findings from animal models and small human studies are encouraging, more rigorous, large-scale clinical trials are necessary to definitively determine its efficacy, safety, and optimal protocols for managing MS. Given the potential of IF to influence key pathological processes in MS, further investigation is warranted. However, due to the current limited evidence, healthcare professionals should advise patients cautiously and emphasize the need for more research before recommending IF as a standard intervention.

## **3. The Role of Exercise and Physical Activity in Managing MS: Evidence and Mechanisms**

A substantial body of evidence indicates that regular exercise and physical activity offer numerous benefits for individuals living with MS 27. These benefits include improvements in aerobic capacity, muscle strength, flexibility, balance, walking ability, walking endurance, cognitive function, reduced fatigue, and an enhanced overall quality of life. A comprehensive meta-analysis encompassing 40 randomized controlled trials with over 2000 participants has further solidified these findings, demonstrating statistically significant positive effects of exercise across a range of key MS-related outcomes, such as balance, walking, fatigue, and quality of life 27. Notably, the analysis revealed that resistance exercise is particularly effective in alleviating fatigue, while aerobic exercise yields the most significant improvements in quality of life 27. Furthermore, younger individuals with MS tend to experience a greater reduction in fatigue through participation in exercise interventions 27.

The positive impacts of exercise in MS are thought to be mediated through several interconnected mechanisms. Research suggests that exercise can modulate the autoimmune response characteristic of MS by limiting the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the central nervous system, curbing the overactivation of these immune cells, and promoting a shift in the immune balance towards an anti-inflammatory state 61. Animal studies have also provided evidence that regular exercise training can promote the process of remyelination, which is the repair of damaged myelin, alleviate demyelination, and enhance neuroplasticity, which is the brain's ability to adapt and form new connections, by influencing the activity and function of oligodendrocytes and neurons 61. Additionally, exercise appears to exert neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress within the CNS, a key factor in the neurodegeneration observed in MS 61. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that consistent exercise over several months in individuals with MS can help preserve the volume of certain brain regions, such as the cortex, pallidum, and hippocampus, as well as maintain the microstructural integrity of important neural pathways 61. On a functional level, exercise has been found to improve the connectivity between different brain regions, including those involved in motor control and cognitive processes 61. The convergence of robust evidence from meta-analyses and the identification of plausible biological mechanisms strongly advocates for the inclusion of exercise as a fundamental component of MS management. The immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and neuroplastic effects of exercise provide a compelling scientific basis for its therapeutic benefits in this population. The consistency of these positive findings across numerous studies, coupled with the growing understanding of how exercise influences the CNS and immune system, provides healthcare professionals with a solid foundation to confidently recommend and prescribe exercise programs that are tailored to the individual needs and abilities of their patients with MS. Moreover, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis specifically focused on the safety of exercise training in MS has found no evidence indicating a higher risk of relapse, adverse events, or serious adverse events in individuals participating in exercise programs compared to those in non-exercise control groups 30. This finding further reinforces the safety of exercise as a valuable intervention for MS. Various types of exercise, including aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and multicomponent training programs that combine different exercise modalities, have all demonstrated effectiveness in improving different aspects of MS-related outcomes 27. This suggests that a personalized approach to exercise prescription, taking into account individual preferences, functional limitations, and specific goals, is the most appropriate strategy for individuals with MS.

## **4. Stress Management Techniques for MS: Efficacy and Impact on Disease Pathology**

Psychological stress is a common experience for individuals living with multiple sclerosis, often arising from the unpredictable nature of the disease, the burden of its symptoms, and the resulting impact on daily life 52. Many people with MS report that stress can exacerbate their existing symptoms, including pain, fatigue, and depression 52. While some research has suggested a potential link between prolonged or severe stress and an increased risk of MS relapses or the development of new lesions visible on MRI, the findings in this area have not been entirely consistent across all studies 33. It is thought that an individual's perception of and ability to cope with stress may be a more significant determinant of its impact than the nature or intensity of the stressor itself 52. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have evaluated the effectiveness of stress management interventions for adults with MS. These studies generally indicate that both group and individual-based stress management techniques, including cognitive behavioral approaches and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), can be effective in promoting self-management of stress, reducing levels of anxiety and depression, and improving overall quality of life for individuals with MS 31. Notably, one study providing high-quality evidence suggested that participation in stress management therapy could even influence the MS disease process by reducing the formation of new brain lesions and prolonging the time period without the appearance of new lesions on MRI 32. Stress management techniques are believed to exert their effects on MS by modulating the inflammatory status of the disease 19. The body's physiological response to stress involves the release of various hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can have both immediate and long-term effects on the immune system 53. Some research indicates that while acute stressful events might initially have a protective effect by increasing glucocorticoids that suppress immune activity, moderate or chronic stress could potentially increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which might exacerbate disease activity in MS 53. Intriguingly, studies utilizing functional MRI (fMRI) have shown that neural activity triggered by relaxation following a stressful task can be associated with improvements in mood among individuals with MS, suggesting a direct link between the brain's processing of stress and psychological well-being 64. Given the significant impact of stress on the overall well-being of individuals with MS and the emerging evidence suggesting a potential influence on disease activity, the integration of effective stress management techniques into comprehensive MS care is of paramount importance. The findings from the literature support the use of various psychological interventions as valuable adjuncts to standard medical treatments for MS. The link between stress and MS symptoms is widely acknowledged by individuals living with the condition. Research demonstrating the efficacy of stress management interventions on both psychological outcomes and potentially on the underlying disease process underscores the importance of healthcare professionals actively addressing this aspect of lifestyle and offering appropriate support and resources to their patients. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), which focus on cultivating present moment awareness without judgment, have shown promise in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression in people with MS, with meta-analyses indicating small to moderate beneficial treatment effects 34. Factors such as physical disability can sometimes limit access to traditional in-person MBI courses, but online formats, offering both real-time and on-demand sessions, appear to be acceptable and potentially more accessible alternatives for individuals with MS 34. Participants in MBI programs often report benefiting from the shared experience with others who understand the challenges of living with MS and emphasize the crucial role of instructors in guiding them to effectively practice mindfulness in the context of their specific MS-related difficulties 34. A variety of stress management techniques have been explored for individuals with MS, including meditation, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation training exercises, and other complementary therapies 5. The most appropriate technique or combination of techniques should be personalized based on the individual's preferences, needs, and the specific challenges they face in managing stress.

## **5. Sleep Hygiene in Multiple Sclerosis: Its Importance and Potential Interventions**

Sleep problems are highly prevalent among individuals living with multiple sclerosis, with approximately half or more reporting difficulties, a rate significantly higher than that observed in the general population 35. These sleep disturbances can manifest in various forms, including insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea; periodic limb movement disorders, including restless legs syndrome; and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder 35. Alarmingly, these sleep disturbances in individuals with MS often go undiagnosed and therefore undertreated 35. Inadequate or poor-quality sleep can exert a substantial negative impact on various aspects of living with MS. It can exacerbate common MS symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and cognitive dysfunction, including difficulties with memory and thinking 35. Furthermore, poor sleep can negatively affect mood, leading to increased irritability and a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety, ultimately diminishing overall quality of life 35. Emerging evidence also suggests that chronic sleep deprivation may contribute to cognitive decline in both individuals with and without MS 54. Meta-analyses utilizing polysomnography (PSG), a comprehensive sleep study that records brain waves, blood oxygen levels, heart rate, breathing, and eye and leg movements during sleep, have revealed specific and significant sleep abnormalities in patients with MS compared to healthy controls 35. These abnormalities include reductions in stage N2 sleep, a stage of stable sleep, and overall sleep efficiency, as well as increases in wake time after sleep onset (WASO), the periodic limb movement index (PLMI), and the periodic limb movement arousal index (PLMAI). These findings indicate that while the total amount of sleep might appear similar between individuals with and without MS, the quality and underlying architecture of their sleep are often significantly compromised 35. Behavioral interventions, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and general education and self-management support focused on establishing and maintaining good sleep hygiene practices, have shown promising results in improving sleep outcomes for people with MS 38. These non-pharmacological interventions are considered safe for both short-term and long-term use and may be more accessible and sustainable than relying solely on medications to address sleep problems 38. The relationship between sleep and MS is complex and likely bidirectional. Sleep disturbances may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of MS by affecting immune function and neuroinflammation 66. Specifically, sleep can influence the transport of cytokines across the blood-brain barrier, and these cytokines play a role in both regulating sleep and contributing to neuroinflammation in MS 66. Conversely, MS-related symptoms such as nocturia (frequent nighttime urination), muscle spasms, pain, and anxiety can directly disrupt sleep patterns and reduce sleep quality 54. Recognizing and addressing sleep disturbances is therefore a critical component of providing comprehensive care for individuals with MS. Poor sleep can significantly impact other MS symptoms and potentially contribute to the progression of the disease. Implementing and maintaining good sleep hygiene practices, along with considering behavioral therapies like CBT-I, should be integral to the overall management plan. Establishing and adhering to good sleep hygiene practices is fundamental for improving sleep quality. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up around the same time each day, even on weekends; creating a relaxing and consistent bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing relaxation exercises; ensuring that the sleep environment is comfortable, dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature; avoiding stimulants like caffeine and nicotine, as well as heavy meals and excessive fluids, close to bedtime; and limiting exposure to electronic devices and bright lights in the hours leading up to sleep 36. Effectively managing underlying MS symptoms that commonly interfere with sleep, such as pain, bladder dysfunction, and muscle spasticity, is also crucial for promoting better sleep quality 54.

## **6. Supplementation in MS: Examining the Evidence for Vitamin D, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and CBD**

Observational studies have consistently indicated a link between lower serum vitamin D levels and an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, as well as a potential association with higher disease activity and faster progression in individuals already diagnosed with the condition 2. Vitamin D is known to play a vital role in regulating the immune system, promoting immunological tolerance, and reducing inflammatory responses, which are key processes involved in the pathogenesis of MS 2. It also exhibits potential neuroprotective effects and may influence the function of the blood-brain barrier 68. Despite the strong biological rationale and the findings from observational studies, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials that have investigated the efficacy of high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation (at doses of 1000 IU per day or higher) as an add-on treatment for MS have generally not demonstrated a significant impact on key clinical outcomes, such as the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or the annualized relapse rate (ARR), over study periods ranging from 6 to 24 months 39. Similarly, a meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant reduction in the number of new T2 lesions on MRI with vitamin D3 supplementation 39. However, some individual studies and reviews have suggested a possible modest decrease in relapse rates and radiological inflammatory activity with vitamin D supplementation, although these findings have not been consistently observed across all research 41. Notably, some research indicates that vitamin D supplementation may have a positive influence on mental health in individuals with MS, including a reduction in depressive symptoms and an improvement in overall quality of life 42. While the association between low vitamin D levels and MS risk is well-established, the evidence from intervention trials regarding the use of high-dose supplementation as a primary treatment to improve clinical or radiological outcomes remains inconclusive. The potential benefits for mental health and the non-significant trend towards a reduction in lesion activity warrant further investigation, particularly to determine the optimal dosages and identify specific subgroups of patients with MS who might experience the most benefit from this intervention. The strong biological rationale for vitamin D's role in immune modulation within the context of MS necessitates continued research. Future studies should focus on evaluating longer-term outcomes, exploring the effects of different dosages of vitamin D, and investigating the potential for vitamin D supplementation to act synergistically with other therapeutic or lifestyle interventions.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which are abundant in fish oil, are well-known for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties 3. These properties make them potential candidates for managing the inflammatory processes that are central to the pathogenesis of MS. Omega-3s are thought to exert their effects by influencing the production of inflammatory markers, modulating the function of immune cells, and affecting gene expression 43. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on various outcomes in individuals with MS. Some of these studies suggest that omega-3s may have beneficial effects on improving the quality of life of individuals with MS, possibly by reducing levels of inflammatory markers and the frequency of relapses 3. Higher dietary intake or blood concentrations of DHA have been associated with lower scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), indicating a potential link between omega-3s and reduced disability in MS 44. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to upregulate the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and downregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in MS 44. However, other meta-analyses have not found a significant impact of omega-3 supplementation on EDSS scores or all pro-inflammatory markers 43. It is also possible that the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation may vary depending on factors such as the stage of disease progression in individuals with MS 3. The evidence suggests that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation holds promise as a potential adjunctive therapy for MS, particularly in improving quality of life and possibly influencing relapse rates and the progression of disability. However, the findings from the existing research are not entirely consistent, and further well-designed studies are needed to determine the optimal type, dosage, and duration of omega-3 supplementation that would be most beneficial for individuals with MS. Additionally, research is needed to identify specific subgroups of MS patients who are most likely to experience positive outcomes from omega-3 supplementation. The established anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids provide a strong rationale for their potential benefits in the context of MS. Future research should prioritize conducting rigorous randomized controlled trials that utilize standardized omega-3 preparations and dosages to provide more definitive answers regarding their efficacy.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from the cannabis plant, has demonstrated a range of potentially therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiemetic, antipsychotic, and neuroprotective properties 4. These properties suggest that CBD may have a role in managing some of the symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the efficacy of cannabinoids, including CBD, in managing MS symptoms. The strongest evidence from these reviews supports the use of nabiximols (Sativex®), which is an oromucosal spray containing a 1:1 ratio of THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD, for the treatment of spasticity in adult patients with MS who have not experienced adequate relief from other therapies 46. Studies have consistently shown that nabiximols can lead to a significant reduction in patient-reported spasticity and improvements in subjective measures of spasticity. There is also some evidence suggesting potential benefits of cannabinoids for managing other MS-related symptoms, such as pain, bladder dysfunction, and sleep disturbances, although the findings for these symptoms are less consistent across studies 48. However, it is important to note that the National MS Society advises that the risks associated with inhaled cannabis products likely outweigh any potential benefits for individuals with MS 94. Regarding the use of CBD oil in isolation, current guidelines and research do not specifically recommend medicines containing only CBD oil for the management of MS 95. While CBD, particularly in combination with THC as in nabiximols, has shown efficacy in managing MS-related spasticity, the evidence for its use in treating other MS symptoms and for CBD used alone is less conclusive. The integration of cannabis-based products into the treatment plans for individuals with MS requires careful consideration of legal and regulatory frameworks, potential interactions with other medications that the patient may be taking (as CBD can affect liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism), and the quality and labeling accuracy of commercially available CBD products, which can vary considerably 96. The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in the context of MS warrants continued exploration through rigorous scientific research. Future studies should focus on clearly defining CBD formulations, dosages, and delivery methods for specific MS symptoms, while also thoroughly addressing safety concerns and navigating the complex regulatory landscape surrounding these products. Healthcare professionals should engage in informed and balanced discussions with their patients about the potential benefits and risks of cannabis-based treatments, ensuring that all recommendations align with local laws and established clinical guidelines.

## **7. Potential Mechanisms of Action of Lifestyle Interventions in MS**

A central characteristic of multiple sclerosis is chronic inflammation within the central nervous system, which drives the demyelination and axonal damage that lead to neurological disability. A significant number of lifestyle interventions have demonstrated the potential to modulate these inflammatory processes through a variety of biological mechanisms 1. For instance, anti-inflammatory dietary patterns, which are typically rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, can directly influence the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are signaling molecules that promote inflammation, and can also modulate the activity of various immune cells involved in the MS disease process 71. Regular exercise has been shown to promote a shift in the body's immune profile from a predominantly pro-inflammatory state to one that is more anti-inflammatory, potentially helping to dampen the overactive immune response in MS 61. Stress management techniques, such as mindfulness and meditation, may help to regulate the body's stress response system, which in turn can have a significant impact on inflammation levels throughout the body 51.

Protecting neurons from damage and promoting their survival, a process known as neuroprotection, is a critical therapeutic goal in the management of MS. Several lifestyle interventions have demonstrated potential neuroprotective mechanisms. The MIND diet, with its specific emphasis on foods known to benefit brain health, has been associated with the preservation of brain tissue integrity in individuals with MS 11. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, may offer protection to nerve cells and the myelin sheath that surrounds them 14. Regular exercise has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to the neurodegeneration observed in MS, and may also enhance the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports the survival and function of neurons 61. Cannabidiol (CBD) has also been found to possess both antioxidant and neuroprotective properties, suggesting a potential role in safeguarding neurons from damage in the context of MS 4.

Promoting the repair of damaged myelin, a process known as remyelination, is a significant therapeutic objective in MS as it could potentially restore neurological function and protect denuded axons from further damage. While research in this area is still progressing, some lifestyle interventions have shown promise in preclinical studies. For example, animal studies have indicated that regular exercise training can effectively promote the process of remyelination within the central nervous system 61. Similarly, intermittent fasting has been associated with enhanced remyelination in animal models of MS 57. However, it is important to note that further research is necessary to determine if these encouraging effects observed in animal models can be replicated in humans living with MS.

The gut microbiome, the complex community of microorganisms that resides in the digestive tract, is increasingly recognized for its significant role in influencing the immune system and inflammation, both of which are central to the pathogenesis of MS. Diet has a profound impact on the composition and function of the gut microbiome 5. For instance, dietary patterns that are rich in fiber and those that align with the Mediterranean diet have been associated with a more diverse and potentially beneficial gut microbial profile in individuals, including an increased production of short-chain fatty acids, which are known to have immunomodulatory effects that could be beneficial in the context of MS 124. Intermittent fasting has also been shown to alter the composition of the gut microbiome in ways that may be beneficial in the context of autoimmune diseases such as MS 57. The multifaceted mechanisms through which lifestyle interventions may impact MS highlight the intricate interconnectedness of diet, exercise, stress, sleep, and the body's fundamental physiological processes. Further research aimed at specifically elucidating these pathways will be crucial for the development of targeted and effective lifestyle-based therapeutic strategies for individuals living with multiple sclerosis. Understanding the specific molecular pathways and biological targets of these interventions will allow for a more personalized and evidence-informed approach to the integration of lifestyle medicine in MS care.

## **8. Integrating Lifestyle Medicine into Mainstream Healthcare for MS**

Lifestyle medicine is an evolving medical specialty that emphasizes the use of evidence-based therapeutic lifestyle interventions as a primary approach to prevent, treat, and often reverse chronic conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and obesity 76. Within the healthcare community, there is a growing recognition of the significant role that lifestyle factors play in the development and progression of chronic diseases, including neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis 77. Despite this increasing awareness, the integration of lifestyle medicine into mainstream healthcare practices for MS faces several significant barriers and challenges. One major hurdle is the **lack of adequate training and education** that most physicians and other healthcare professionals receive in the principles and application of lifestyle medicine during their medical education and residency programs 77. This often results in a lack of confidence and the necessary skills to effectively incorporate lifestyle counseling into routine clinical practice. Another significant challenge is the **time constraints** that are inherent in many current healthcare settings, particularly in primary care, where appointment times are often brief 80. This limited time makes it difficult for physicians to adequately address the complex and often time-intensive lifestyle issues with their patients during standard consultations. **Reimbursement and insurance coverage** also present substantial barriers, as lifestyle interventions such as nutritional counseling, exercise programs, and stress management therapies are often poorly reimbursed by insurance companies compared to pharmaceutical or procedural interventions 77. This lack of financial incentive can discourage healthcare providers and systems from prioritizing and investing in lifestyle-based approaches. **Patient adherence and motivation** to adopt and maintain long-term lifestyle changes can also be a significant challenge due to various individual, social, and economic factors 80. Addressing underlying psychological barriers such as low mood, lack of social support, and amotivation is often crucial for improving patient adherence 83. The **influence of the pharmaceutical industry** on the current healthcare model, which often heavily favors pharmacological treatments for managing chronic diseases, can also overshadow the importance and potential benefits of lifestyle interventions 77. Finally, healthcare professionals may lack sufficient knowledge about available lifestyle intervention programs and established **referral pathways** to qualified professionals such as registered dietitians, exercise physiologists, or health coaches within their communities or through telehealth services 80. These multiple systemic barriers hinder the widespread integration of lifestyle medicine into routine clinical practice for individuals with MS. Overcoming these challenges will necessitate a multi-faceted approach involving significant changes in medical education, healthcare policies, reimbursement models, and clinical workflows to prioritize and support lifestyle-based care.

Despite these challenges, the **potential benefits and cost-effectiveness** of integrating lifestyle medicine into the management of MS are substantial. By addressing the underlying lifestyle factors that contribute to MS symptoms and potentially influence disease progression, lifestyle medicine has the potential to reduce the reliance on pharmaceutical interventions, which can have associated side effects and may not fully address all aspects of the disease 77. As highlighted in previous sections of this report, evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions such as dietary changes, exercise, stress management, and improved sleep can lead to significant improvements in various MS-related symptoms, functional abilities, and overall quality of life 77. Furthermore, by targeting key pathological processes involved in MS, such as inflammation and neurodegeneration, lifestyle interventions may play a role in slowing down or even potentially reversing the progression of the disease in some individuals 77. While the initial investment in implementing comprehensive lifestyle medicine programs might seem significant, studies in other chronic diseases have consistently demonstrated that these interventions can be highly cost-effective in the long term by reducing the need for expensive medical procedures, hospitalizations, and medications 77. The potential for improved patient outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and a greater focus on disease prevention and management makes the integration of lifestyle medicine a compelling goal for the care of individuals with MS.

The integration of lifestyle medicine into MS care requires careful consideration of several **ethical and practical considerations**. It is paramount to always respect **patient autonomy and individual choices** when promoting lifestyle interventions. Healthcare professionals should provide patients with comprehensive and unbiased information about the potential benefits and risks of different interventions, empowering them to make informed decisions that align with their personal values, preferences, and beliefs 88. It is also crucial to ensure that lifestyle medicine interventions are **accessible and equitable for all individuals** with MS, regardless of their socioeconomic status, cultural background, or geographic location 82. Healthcare systems need to actively identify and address potential barriers that might prevent certain populations from accessing or fully benefiting from these interventions. When discussing lifestyle choices with patients, healthcare professionals must be mindful of their language and avoid any phrasing that could be perceived as blaming or judgmental. It is important to acknowledge the complex interplay of individual, social, and environmental factors that influence health behaviors 87. The increasing availability of drugs marketed for lifestyle enhancements also raises **ethical questions about the distinction between lifestyle choices and legitimate medical needs**, particularly in the context of resource allocation within healthcare systems 87. Finally, when robust scientific evidence clearly confirms that specific lifestyle changes can lead to improved disease outcomes, healthcare professionals may have an **ethical obligation to recommend and even "prescribe" these changes** to their patients, even if the implementation of such changes can sometimes be challenging 89. A thoughtful and ethical approach to promoting lifestyle medicine is essential to maximize its benefits while minimizing any potential harms or unintended consequences, ensuring that it is implemented in a way that is truly patient-centered and equitable for all individuals living with MS.

The use of **CBD (cannabidiol)** in the management of MS presents a specific area for consideration regarding integration. While some individuals with MS report using non-inhaled cannabis products, including those containing CBD, to help manage their symptoms, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any cannabis-based medications specifically for treating MS symptoms 94. However, nabiximols (Sativex®), a prescription oromucosal spray that contains a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD, is approved in several regions as an adjunctive treatment for moderate to severe spasticity in adults with MS who have not experienced adequate relief from other therapies 46. Therefore, CBD, particularly in combination with THC, can be considered as a potential adjunctive treatment option for specific MS symptoms like spasticity and pain, but this should always be under the close supervision of a healthcare professional and in compliance with relevant state and local laws 94. Due to potential respiratory risks associated with inhaled cannabis products, non-inhaled forms are generally preferred 94. Healthcare professionals need to be aware of potential drug interactions between CBD and other medications that patients with MS may be taking, as CBD can affect liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism 96. Furthermore, the quality and labeling accuracy of commercially available CBD products can vary significantly, which is an important consideration for both patients and clinicians 96. The integration of CBD into MS treatment plans requires careful consideration of these factors, along with staying informed about the evolving research and regulatory landscape surrounding cannabis-based therapies.

Several healthcare systems and programs have successfully integrated lifestyle medicine principles into their care models, providing valuable examples for others to consider. **Midland Health (MH)** in Texas implemented an intensive 8-week lifestyle intervention program called the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) for its employees. This program, which focused on plant-based nutrition, regular exercise, and behavioral changes, resulted in significant improvements in participants' health metrics, a reduced need for prescription medications, and demonstrated cost savings for the healthcare system 91. MH also actively fostered a broader "culture of health" through various initiatives within the hospital setting and the surrounding community 91. The **Ornish Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation (ICR) program**, which involves comprehensive lifestyle modifications including a primarily vegetarian diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management techniques, has shown remarkable success in reversing coronary artery disease and has also demonstrated significant cost savings by reducing the need for expensive and invasive cardiac procedures 79. The **National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)** serves as another prominent example of a successful lifestyle intervention program that has been proven to be more effective than metformin, a commonly prescribed diabetes medication, in preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals identified as having prediabetes 77. The **American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM)** is actively engaged in promoting the integration of lifestyle medicine into healthcare systems across the United States through various initiatives, including providing education and training resources for healthcare professionals and advocating for policy changes that support lifestyle-based care 77. Their Health Systems Council comprises a network of integrated health systems across the country that are committed to expanding their lifestyle medicine service offerings and sharing their experiences and learnings with other member organizations 93. These examples collectively demonstrate that the successful integration of lifestyle medicine into healthcare often involves a multi-faceted approach. This includes the implementation of structured programs with clearly defined protocols, the provision of adequate training and ongoing support for healthcare professionals, a strong organizational commitment to creating a culture of health and wellness, and a proactive approach to addressing potential barriers related to reimbursement, patient access, and social determinants of health. Learning from the experiences and established models of these healthcare systems and programs can provide valuable insights and practical guidance for other organizations looking to effectively integrate lifestyle medicine approaches into their care for individuals living with multiple sclerosis and other chronic conditions.

## **9. Evidence-Based Recommendations for Promoting the Adoption of Lifestyle Medicine in Clinical Practice for MS**

To facilitate the broader adoption of lifestyle medicine in clinical practice for individuals with multiple sclerosis, several evidence-based recommendations can be implemented. Firstly, it is essential to **enhance medical education** by integrating comprehensive and evidence-based lifestyle medicine training into the curricula of medical schools, nursing programs, and other allied health professions 77. This training should include in-depth instruction on nutrition, exercise prescription, stress management techniques, sleep hygiene strategies, and effective behavioral change counseling. Furthermore, continuing medical education opportunities should be provided to practicing healthcare professionals to enhance their knowledge and skills in the field of lifestyle medicine. Secondly, there is a need to **develop specific clinical guidelines and protocols** for the use of various lifestyle interventions in the management of MS, based on the available scientific evidence 77. These guidelines should offer practical recommendations regarding dietary approaches, exercise prescriptions (including the type, intensity, and duration of activity), stress management techniques, and sleep hygiene strategies, taking into account the specific needs and challenges faced by individuals with MS. Thirdly, fostering **interdisciplinary collaboration** among healthcare professionals is crucial. Neurologists should work closely with other specialists who have expertise in lifestyle interventions, such as registered dietitians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, mental health counselors, and certified lifestyle medicine specialists, to provide comprehensive and integrated care for individuals with MS 84. Addressing **reimbursement barriers** is also critical for the widespread adoption of lifestyle medicine. Advocacy efforts are needed to promote policy changes that improve insurance coverage and reimbursement for lifestyle medicine services, recognizing their potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce long-term healthcare costs 77. Exploring innovative payment models that incentivize the delivery of lifestyle-based care should also be considered. To empower patients, it is important to **develop and disseminate accessible and reliable patient education resources** that explain the benefits of lifestyle interventions in managing MS and provide practical guidance on how to implement these changes in their daily lives 78. Healthcare providers should also **implement routine lifestyle screening and assessment** as part of the standard clinical care for individuals with MS. This involves systematically assessing key lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, physical activity levels, stress levels, and sleep patterns using validated tools to identify areas where interventions might be most beneficial. Establishing clear and efficient **referral pathways** for neurologists and other healthcare providers to connect their patients with qualified lifestyle medicine professionals and evidence-based lifestyle intervention programs within their communities or through telehealth services is also essential 80. Continued **support for high-quality research** is vital to further investigate the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of various lifestyle interventions in managing MS. This includes funding large-scale randomized controlled trials that address the methodological limitations of previous studies. The **utilization of technology** should be explored to enhance the delivery and support of lifestyle interventions. Digital health tools, such as mobile applications, wearable devices, and telehealth platforms, can be valuable for tracking patient progress, providing ongoing support and motivation, and delivering interventions remotely 85. Finally, it is crucial to **recognize and address the social determinants of health** that can significantly impact an individual's ability to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyle behaviors. Healthcare systems and providers should develop strategies to mitigate these barriers and promote health equity in the delivery of lifestyle medicine for individuals with MS.

## **10. Conclusion: The Future of Lifestyle Interventions in Multiple Sclerosis Management**

In conclusion, while the scientific evidence supporting specific dietary interventions for MS is still evolving, a generally healthy dietary pattern that emphasizes whole, unprocessed foods and limits pro-inflammatory components like saturated fats and processed foods appears to offer benefits. Exercise is strongly supported by research as a means to improve various aspects of living with MS, including physical function, fatigue, and quality of life. Managing stress and prioritizing good sleep hygiene are also crucial for the overall well-being of individuals with MS and may have positive implications for disease activity. Supplementation with Vitamin D and Omega-3 fatty acids shows some promise as adjunctive therapies, but further research is needed to clarify optimal dosages and specific benefits. CBD, particularly in combination with THC, has demonstrated efficacy in managing certain MS symptoms, most notably spasticity. Emerging trends in the field point towards the importance of personalized lifestyle medicine approaches that take into account individual genetic and environmental factors. Future research should continue to explore the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and MS, and how lifestyle interventions can be used to modulate it for therapeutic benefit. Long-term studies that evaluate the impact of sustained lifestyle changes on the progression of MS are also essential. Integrating lifestyle medicine as a complementary approach to conventional medical treatments offers a holistic and patient-centered model of care for individuals living with multiple sclerosis. By actively addressing modifiable risk factors and empowering patients to take a more active role in managing their health, the goal is to achieve improved outcomes and an enhanced overall quality of life. The future of MS management likely lies in a comprehensive strategy that effectively combines the advancements in disease-modifying therapies with the significant potential of evidence-based lifestyle interventions, ultimately striving to optimize the health and well-being of all individuals living with this challenging condition.
